# **Why Distributed Systems?**

Distributed systems are highly scalable and are designed to:
1. Handle **millions of users**  
2. Manage **petabytes of data**  
3. Provide a **consistent user experience**

## **The Cloud and Distributed Systems**
- Even the simplest website runs on a distributed system.  
- Cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP** are distributed systems designed for companies and software developers to:
  - Scale efficiently  
  - Ensure reliability  
  - Provide seamless performance

## **Problems of a Centralized System**

Centralized systems face several challenges:
1. **Performance and Storage Limitations**:  
   - Vertical scalability hits hardware limits.  

2. **Single Point of Failure**:  
   - Outages can lead to **loss of money** and **trust**.  

3. **High Latency**:  
   - Causes poor user experience.  

4. **Security and Privacy Concerns**:  
   - Centralized systems are vulnerable to:  
     - Hackers  
     - **DDoS attacks**  
     - Other threats

## **Solution: Distributed Systems**

### **What is a Distributed System?**
> "A Distributed System is a system of several processes running on different computers, communicating with each other through a network, sharing a state, or working together to achieve a common goal."

### **Why Distributed Systems Are the Answer**
- **Fault Tolerance**: Avoid single points of failure.  
- **Scalability**: Handle exponential growth in users and data.  
- **Low Latency**: Provide a seamless experience to users worldwide.  
- **Enhanced Security**: Use decentralized strategies to reduce risks.
